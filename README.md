# Methodology:
The Software Development Model
We use agile methodology to develop our software:
Agile methodology is a flexible and iterative approach that focuses on delivering working software in short iterations.
 It involves continuous collaboration between the development team and the stakeholders, allowing for frequent feedback and adjustments to be made throughout the development process.
For a food delivery application, this approach would be ideal as it allows for quick adaptation to changing customer needs and preferences. So, we can always ensure that the application meets the customer's requirements.
 Agile methodology emphasizes testing and quality assurance throughout the development process, ensuring that the final product is reliable and user-friendly. This is crucial for a food delivery application as it involves handling sensitive customer information such as payment details and delivery addresses.
